# DarkDarkGo

**DarkDarkGo** is a scalable search engine for the dark web. The goal of the
project is to build a simple, robust search engine from scratch that can search
through the dark web content.

## Project Status

It is still a work-in-progress. The last time we tested (December 2017), the
dark web did not give us enough results to serve for a query. However, each
component was working and tested separately. Hence, this project can be
used as a foundation to add more interesting features and build a more complex
product.
